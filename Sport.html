<h1>My Interests</h1>
<p>Sport: Football is my favourite sport. i've been playing football from a very young and enjoyed playing it. My career so far has been very successful and I hope my success continues into my senior footballing years.
Training:
We have hard running sessions on the mardyke running track whilst we're away from home and we have good ball sessions on Friday's and Sunday's whilst everyone is home from college.
Matches:
Usually our matches are on saturdays and sundays during the college year, but during the summer games can also be played on wednesday's

Sporting Achievements:
Underage I was very lucky to be part of many talented teams and I have won many county leagues and championships.</p>
